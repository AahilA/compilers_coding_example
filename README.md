# Compilers Coding Example

Due to potential academic integrity violations I am puting only snippets of my compilers project here to demonstrate my coding ability. The reason I chose this project was becase we wrote the enitre system of over 10000 lines of code from scratch and I am very proud of our work.

This repository contains highlights of our compilers project, specifically the optimizations such as Dead Code elimation, loop invariant code motion, copy propogation and colouring register allocation algorithm (all optimizations I either majorly wrote or incase of the last one contributed to a lot of debugging). All optimizations taken from Professor Andrew Myer's class or Modern Compiler Implementation in Java, 2nd ed. Andrew Appel and Jens Palsberg. 

With these optimizations and our base code, we were able to somehow win the "Best Compiler Award", in Cornells Compilers Class.
